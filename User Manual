1). To run the program, enter the command "java Run" into the terminal.
2). The GUI should show up, revealing buttons for managing users, books, and CDs. It should also show an exit button.

  Warning : Exiting the program by other methods than the exit button may cause losses

3). Manage Users brings up the menu with buttons to add a user, remove a user, and check a user's checkouts, along with a "back" button to return to the base GUI
4). Manage Books brings up the menu with buttons to add a book, remove a book, checkout a book, or return a book, along with a "back" button
5). Manage CDs brings up a very similar GUI to Manage Books, having buttons to add a CD, remove a CD, checkout a CD and return a CD, with a "back" button

6). Each button in these GUIs brings up a final GUI that will ask specifically for all information it needs to perform its given function, making it very user friendly.
